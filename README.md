### Introduction
Breakdown-fy is an addon that lets you create breakdown animations you would see in animation Behind the Scenes videos. This tool automates the
tedious task of manually animating each object one at a time, and manages to be flexible at the same time. There are many variables that you can control, 
in order to create the scene best suited for your needs.

### Getting Started 
1. Open a new project in blender
2. Select the default cube, and open the side panel (key N by default) and find Breakdown-fy addon
3. Click the **Breakdown-fy!** button and you have just created a breakdown animation!

There are numerous ways you can create breakdown animations. You can select all of the objects, select few objects at a time and drop them in a different intervals, dropping objects in different heights and time, etc. 

### Create New Scene 
This option creates the breakdown animation on a separate scene. This option is on by default. After creating a breakdown animation, the option turns off to prevent new scenes from being created by accident, but it can be turned on again if needed. 

### Height
Height variable changes the height which the objects will be dropping from. To achieve the objects coming out from the ground, set the values to negative ones. 

### Offset
Offset variable controls the offset in which the objects fall. Default value for this variable is 5. 

### Start Frame
Start Frame controls which frame the animation begins. Default value for this variable is 1.

### End Frame 
End Frame controls which frame the animation ends. Default value for this variable is 30.
